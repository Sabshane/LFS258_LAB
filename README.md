LFS258 Lab: Introduction to Kubernetes

Welcome to the LFS258 Lab! This lab is designed to accompany the Linux Foundation's course LFS258 - Introduction to Kubernetes, providing hands-on experience with Kubernetes concepts and operations.

Prerequisites:
Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

A basic understanding of Linux operating system concepts.
Familiarity with containerization concepts, such as Docker.
Installed Docker on your system.
Basic knowledge of networking and system administration.
Lab Setup:
To set up your lab environment, follow these steps:

Install Minikube: Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes clusters locally. Install Minikube by following the instructions provided in the official documentation.

Start Minikube: Once Minikube is installed, start the Minikube cluster using the minikube start command.

Verify Installation: Confirm that Minikube is running correctly by running kubectl cluster-info. You should see information about the Kubernetes master and services.

Lab Structure:
This lab consists of a series of exercises, each focusing on different aspects of Kubernetes. The exercises are designed to progressively build your understanding of Kubernetes concepts and operations.

Exercise 1: Deploying a Sample Application: In this exercise, you'll deploy a sample application to the Kubernetes cluster and learn about pods, deployments, and services.

Exercise 2: Scaling and Updating Applications: This exercise will cover scaling and updating applications running in the Kubernetes cluster. You'll learn how to scale deployments and perform rolling updates.

Exercise 3: Persistent Storage: Explore persistent storage in Kubernetes by deploying a stateful application and configuring persistent volumes.

Exercise 4: Services and Networking: Learn about Kubernetes networking concepts, including services, ingress, and network policies.

Exercise 5: Monitoring and Logging: Discover how to monitor and log Kubernetes applications using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Exercise 6: Security: Explore Kubernetes security features, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and Pod Security Policies.
